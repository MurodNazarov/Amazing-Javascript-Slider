                        JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features
                        on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static
                        information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated
                        2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably
                        involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which
                        (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area

                    <p>
                        React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as
                        much React as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to a
                        simple HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, the links in this section will help you
                        get started.

                        Vue (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. It
                        builds on top of standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and provides a declarative and
                        component-based programming model that helps you efficiently develop user interfaces, be it
                        simple or complex

                        HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it falters when we try to use it for declaring
                        dynamic views in web-applications. AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your
                        application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to
                        develop.
